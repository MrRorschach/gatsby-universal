I am currently working at Austin Community College as a Front End Developer and Adult Education Math Instructor.

Before I worked mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area. I built [3D printers](https://www.seemecnc.com/products/rostockmax-v3-2-diy-kit-black) and created a [MakerSpace at Cal State East Bay](https://thepioneeronline.com/28311/campus/campus-upgrades-technology-with-3d-printers/#slideshow658180) while designing and implementing Network Administration tools.

During Grad School I also designed and built Internet of Things [art](http://davidgurman.com/reflector/) [installations](http://www.manresagallery.org/lynn-marie-kirby-past-skype-sessions/) for various artists in the Bay Area. We won some awards from Maker Faires for our thesis project: a [pop-up book with embedded circuits](https://www.instagram.com/project_daffodil/) geared at young girls.
